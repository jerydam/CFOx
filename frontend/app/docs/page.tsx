            <Lead>
              CFOx is an autonomous, on-chain treasury management suite for Web3
              organizations. It combines smart-contract governance, AI-driven
              payment execution, and a real-time analytics dashboard into a single
              product you deploy from your wallet — no back-end accounts, no
              custodians.
            </Lead>
            <p className="docs-p">
              Once deployed, CFOx gives your organization three interconnected
              contracts — <Code>Governance</Code>, <Code>Treasury</Code>, and{' '}
              <Code>Policy</Code> — wired together so that spending decisions are
              enforced on-chain, not just in a spreadsheet. An AI agent monitors
              inflows and outflows, auto-executes payments that fall within
              pre-approved limits, and escalates anything above the threshold to
              equity holders for a vote.

              You can have a live treasury in under 60 seconds. Here's the full
              path from nothing to operational:
            </p>
            <StepList>
              <Step n={1} title="Connect your wallet">
                Visit the CFOx landing page and click <strong>Connect Wallet</strong>.
                MetaMask, Rabby, and any WalletConnect-compatible wallet work. Your
                connected address becomes the <strong>founder</strong> — it holds
                100% of the initial equity weight and can add members later.
              </Step>
              <Step n={2} title="Fill in your organization details">
                On the onboard screen, enter your name, your organization name, and
                the three AI spending limits (per-transaction, daily cap, weekly
                cap). These are denominated in USDC and encoded directly into your
                Policy contract — they can be changed later via a governance
                proposal.
              </Step>
              <Step n={3} title="Deploy your CFO suite">
                Hit <strong>Deploy contracts</strong>. A single transaction deploys
                all three contracts in sequence: Governance → Treasury → Policy →
                cross-wired initialization. The whole process takes 5–15 seconds on
                Celo.
              </Step>
              <Step n={4} title="Fund your treasury">
                Send CELO, USDC, or cUSD to your newly deployed Treasury address
                (shown on the success screen). The on-chain indexer picks up
                incoming transactions within one block and surfaces them in your
                dashboard.
              </Step>
              <Step n={5} title="Invite members">
                Go to <strong>Members → Add member</strong> to create an equity
                grant proposal. Once enough existing equity holders approve it, the
                new member's weight is registered on-chain.

              Every founder gets their <strong>own Treasury contract</strong>,
              deployed fresh by the Factory — it is never shared with any other
              organization. It accepts any ERC-20 token or native CELO and
              maintains on-chain balances. All outbound transfers are gated —
              nothing leaves without either a passing governance vote or a valid

              Pausing is a governance action, not a founder-unilateral one — it
              runs through the same <Code>EMERGENCY_ACTION</Code> proposal type as
              everything else critical, requiring the critical threshold (90% by
              default) to execute. While paused, no outbound transfers execute —
              including AI-agent auto-payments. The dashboard surfaces a{' '}

            <Callout type="warning">
              The Treasury contract exposes an <Code>unpause()</Code> function, but
              there is currently no governance proposal type wired up to call it —
              only <Code>pause()</Code> is reachable through the proposal flow.
              Unpausing today requires a direct contract call by whoever the
              Governance contract authorizes; treat this as a known gap until a{' '}
              <Code>createUnpauseProposal</Code> path ships.

            <Callout type="warning">

              The Policy contract is a programmable rule engine that sits between
              the AI agent and the Treasury. Before any auto-payment executes, the
              Policy contract checks three limits simultaneously:

            <p className="docs-p">
              If any limit would be breached, the AI's payment request doesn't
              revert or fail — <Code>checkAndRecordSpend()</Code> tells Governance
              to open a proposal at the matching threshold in the same
              transaction, and the CFO Chat surfaces that a vote is now needed.

              The AI agent is a tool-using LLM (Claude Sonnet) with direct access

            <p className="docs-p">
              Go to <strong>CFO Chat</strong> in the sidebar. Type any question or
              instruction in natural language. Examples:
            </p>
            <CodeBlock>{`"What's our current runway at this burn rate?"
"Pay 500 USDC to 0xABC... for the Figma subscription."

              The agent responds with an explanation of what it did or found. For
              payments, it shows the transaction hash once confirmed. For proposals
              it couldn't auto-execute, it shows the draft for you to review and

            <Callout type="warning">
              The agent uses its own signer wallet — configured once, address-only,
              in the backend's environment — never your personal wallet, and never
              a private key stored in the frontend. That wallet's gas is topped up
              from AI-subscription fees (see next section). The agent only has
              authority within Policy limits — it cannot drain the treasury, and
              anything above those limits is escalated to a governance proposal
              that you and your co-signers pay to approve and execute yourselves.

            <FAQ q="Can I use CFOx without the AI agent?">
              Yes. The AI agent is an optional automation layer. You can submit and
              execute proposals entirely through the dashboard UI or directly via
              the contracts without ever using the CFO Chat page.
            </FAQ>

            <FAQ q="What happens if I lose my Treasury ID?">
              Connect your founder wallet and visit <Code>/onboard</Code>. The
              onboard page queries the Factory contract for any existing instance
              tied to your address. If found, it will offer to restore it with one
              click.
            </FAQ>

            <FAQ q="Can I have multiple treasuries?">
              The Factory allows one instance per founder address. To run multiple
              treasuries, use different wallet addresses as the founder for each.
              The dashboard currently manages one treasury at a time — switch by
              updating your Treasury ID.
            </FAQ>

            <FAQ q="How are USD values calculated?">
              Token USD prices are fetched from on-chain price feeds registered on
              the Policy contract. For CELO, USDC, and cUSD, these are Chainlink
              feeds bridged to Celo. Custom tokens without a registered feed show a
              balance of zero USD in the analytics.
            </FAQ>

            <FAQ q="Is there a fee to use CFOx?">
              CFOx itself charges no protocol fee on governance or treasury
              actions — you only pay on-chain gas for those (very low on Celo,
              typically under $0.01 per transaction). The one paid feature is the
              AI CFO Chat: you get 5 free calls every 28 days, after which
              continuing to chat costs $5 per 28-day period, paid on-chain via{' '}
              <Code>Factory.paySubscription()</Code>. See{' '}
              <Code>Gas &amp; AI subscription</Code> above.
            </FAQ>

            <FAQ q="Can the AI agent drain my treasury?">
              No. The AI agent submits transactions through the Policy contract,
              which enforces your configured per-transaction, daily, and weekly
              limits in a single <Code>require()</Code> check on-chain. Even if the
              agent or backend is fully compromised, it cannot exceed these limits
              without a passing governance vote.
            </FAQ>

            <FAQ q="How do I update the frontend to point to my own backend?">
              Set <Code>NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL</Code> in <Code>frontend/.env</Code> to
              your backend's base URL. All API calls in{' '}
              <Code>lib/api.ts</Code> read from this variable.
